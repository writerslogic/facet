# Facet — Security Audit Brief

**For:** Blake Self
**From:** David Condrey (david@writerslogic.com)
**Subject:** Independent review of the Facet trust & provenance layer
**Status:** Unaudited new cryptographic code. Internally reviewed only (see §7). Seeking an independent external assessment before it ships as a security guarantee.

---

## 1. What Facet is

Facet is a privacy-first, cookieless web analytics service that runs entirely on Cloudflare Workers (workerd) with a D1 (SQLite) backend. The **core analytics product** (event collection, aggregation, dashboard, browser SDK, CLI) is mature and is not the focus of this review.

The focus is the **trust & provenance layer** (`packages/trust`): an opt-in set of cryptographic primitives that let a deployment sign its outputs and prove properties about itself (data-retention attestations, signed stats exports, a transparency log, verifiable credentials, hardware key-attestation). It is **inert unless a signing key is configured**, so a normal deployment never exercises it.

I want an adversary's read on whether these primitives actually deliver the integrity and authenticity they claim, before I present them to users as trustworthy.

## 2. Scope

**In scope — `packages/trust/src/`:**

| Area | Files | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Canonicalization | `canonicalize.ts` | RFC 8785 (JCS) |
| Detached JWS | `jws.ts`, `signed-export.ts` | RFC 7515 |
| HTTP Message Signatures | `http-sig.ts` | RFC 9421 + RFC 9530 |
| Verifiable Credentials | `vc.ts`, `multikey.ts`, `did-web.ts` | W3C VC 2.0 / Data Integrity `eddsa-jcs-2022`, did:web, DIF DID Configuration |
| Selective disclosure | `sd.ts` | SD-JWT-style |
| Transparency log | `mmr.ts`, `checkpoint.ts`, `receipt.ts` | Merkle Mountain Range (draft-bryce COSE-receipts MMR profile) |
| Signed statements / receipts | `scitt.ts`, `statement.ts` | SCITT |
| Remote attestation | `rats.ts`, `keyattest.ts` | RATS EAT, hardware key-attestation |
| COSE | `cose.ts` | RFC 9052 COSE_Sign1 |
| Key + encoding primitives | `keys.ts`, `bytes.ts`, `base58.ts` | Ed25519 / ES256 via Web Crypto + jose |

**Server integration points (in scope for trust-boundary questions):**
`apps/server/src/lib/signing.ts` (key loading), `apps/server/src/lib/transparency.ts` (D1-backed MMR log), `apps/server/src/lib/scitt.ts`, and the `.well-known` / attestation / report routes.

**Out of scope:** the analytics ingestion pipeline, dashboard UI, rate limiting, bot filtering. (Happy to extend scope if you want it.)

## 3. Runtime & cryptographic model

- **Runtime:** Cloudflare Workers (V8 isolate / workerd). All crypto is **Web Crypto (`crypto.subtle`)** plus `jose`; no native modules. This is a deliberate constraint — everything must run in workerd.
- **Algorithms:** Ed25519 (primary) and ECDSA P-256 / SHA-256 (ES256). RFC 9421 uses raw signatures (Ed25519 over the base; ECDSA in IEEE-P1363 r‖s form).
- **Cross-runtime key handling:** private keys are imported via `crypto.subtle.importKey('jwk', …)` rather than jose's `importJWK`, because the latter yields a Node `KeyObject` that `crypto.subtle` cannot use for raw sign/verify. Worth confirming this doesn't introduce a key-handling weakness.
- **Determinism:** Ed25519 signatures are deterministic; several tests rely on this. ES256 is not.

## 4. Trust boundaries & invariants (please try to break these)

1. **Signing key secrecy.** The deployment signing key is the `FACET_SIGNING_JWK` Cloudflare secret. The private key is imported once per isolate and never logged, returned, or written to D1. Only the public key is published (JWKS, did:web). *Verify the private key cannot leak via any signed artifact, error path, or the `.well-known` endpoints.*
2. **No PII in signed artifacts** (hard invariant). Transparency-log leaves commit **aggregate rollup rows** (JCS bytes of site/hostname/bucket/pageviews/visitors counts), never raw events or anything visitor-identifying. Attestations attest a **DEPLOYMENT or DATASET, never a person**. *Verify no code path signs or commits PII.*
3. **Verifier key-pinning.** Verification uses a **caller-supplied** key (JWK, Multikey, or a key resolved from a domain-served DID document) — never a key embedded in the untrusted object being verified. *This is the primary anti-forgery property; verify there is no path where an attacker-signed object selects its own verification key and passes.*
4. **Algorithm binding.** Every raw verify checks that the declared `alg` matches the actual key's algorithm, and the signed bytes include the algorithm (COSE Sig_structure, JWS protected header). *Verify no algorithm-confusion or downgrade.*

## 5. Highest-value verification targets

The verification entry points are where a bug means forgery or bypass:

- `verifyCredential` (`vc.ts`) — eddsa-jcs-2022 proof; recomputes `hashData = SHA-256(JCS(proofConfig)) ‖ SHA-256(JCS(document))`.
- `verifyResponse` (`http-sig.ts`) — RFC 9421; must bind `content-digest` to the body and `alg` to the key.
- `verifyDidConfiguration` (`did-web.ts`) — origin/domain-linkage binding; key comes from the DID document.
- `verifyInclusion` / `verifyConsistency` (`mmr.ts`) — Merkle proofs; must reject interior-node proofs and bind proof peaks to the signed checkpoint root.
- `verifyScittReceipt` / `verifySignedStatement` (`scitt.ts`, `statement.ts`) — receipt-to-statement binding.
- `verifyKeyAttestation` (`keyattest.ts`) — gates `hardware:true` on a caller-supplied **trust-anchor** allowlist by RFC 7638 thumbprint; includes a freshness guard.
- `verifyProcessEvidence` / `verifyPopChallenge` (`rats.ts`) — RATS EAT + proof-of-possession challenge/response.
- `verifyCoseSign` (`cose.ts`), `verifyDetachedProof` / `verifyDetachedJws` (`jws.ts`), `verifySelectiveCredential` disclosure digest binding (`sd.ts`).

**Attack classes I most want tested:** key-substitution / trust-anchor bypass, algorithm confusion, unverified field binding (is every security-relevant field actually inside the signed bytes?), canonicalization collisions or field-position moves, freshness/replay on attestation and PoP, and truncation/boundary issues in base58/base64/hex decoding of attacker input.

## 6. How to build and run

Monorepo (pnpm). From the repo root:

```
pnpm install
pnpm -r typecheck          # all packages
pnpm --filter @facet/trust test   # 100 tests, run in real workerd
pnpm -r test               # full suite (536 tests)
```

Trust tests live in `packages/trust/test/`. They run under `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`, i.e. against the **real workerd runtime**, not a Node shim — so the crypto you review is the crypto that runs in production.

## 7. What has already been checked (so you can skip or re-verify as you see fit)

- **Standards conformance vectors** exist for RFC 8785 (JCS §3.2.2/§3.2.3, including surrogate-pair key ordering), RFC 9421 (independent signature-base reconstruction), and eddsa-jcs-2022 (independent hashData reconstruction). Each rebuilds the spec's signing input from scratch and asserts byte-identical output.
- **An internal adversarial review** of every verification path (the attack classes in §5) found no exploitable vulnerabilities and confirmed the invariants in §4. It flagged two defense-in-depth gaps — VC `validFrom`/`validUntil` and HTTP-signature freshness were not enforced — which are now closeable via opt-in parameters (`verifyCredential({ now })`, `verifyResponse({ now, maxAgeSeconds })`).

This internal review is **not a substitute for your assessment** — it was performed by the same party that wrote the code. Treat its conclusions as claims to falsify, not as findings to trust.

## 8. What I'm asking for

1. An adversarial pass on the §5 verification paths against the §5 attack classes.
2. A judgment on whether the §4 invariants actually hold.
3. Any weakness in key provisioning / secret handling (§4.1).
4. Whether the standards implementations are interoperable and correct enough to claim conformance, or whether I should soften those claims.

Findings in whatever form suits you — file:line + a concrete exploit per issue is ideal. Severity ranking helps me prioritize. A "nothing exploitable found" result, with the coverage you actually ran, is equally valuable.

## 9. Process

Let's run it as a loop so nothing gets lost:

1. **File findings as GitHub issues** on `github.com/writerslogic/facet` — one issue per finding, with file:line, a concrete exploit/repro, and a severity. Label them `security` so they're easy to triage.
2. **I patch** each issue and reference the issue number in the fixing commit, then ping you when a batch is ready.
3. **You re-review** the patches (re-open the issue if a fix is incomplete; close it if it holds).
4. **Official report when everything passes** — once all issues are closed, a short signed-off summary of what you reviewed, what you found, and that the current state passes. That's the document I'd attach when presenting the trust layer as audited.

One exception to step 1: if you find something **critical and actively exploitable**, please use the private security contact below first (coordinated disclosure) rather than opening a public issue, so it can be patched before it's visible. Everything else is fine in the open.

Security contact / disclosure: `security@writerslogic.com` (a deployment serves this at `/.well-known/security.txt`, RFC 9116, built by `apps/server/src/lib/security-txt.ts`). Thanks, Blake.
